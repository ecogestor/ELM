# Extreme Learning Machines

This repository contains my own implementations of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). I implemented that using NumPy and TensorFlow, you can use whatever you want.
I also implemented some variations of this model:
* Online sequential - ELM (OS-ELM)
* Restricted Boltzmann Machine - ELM [(RBM-ELM)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417417308102)
* [RBM-OS-ELM](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ntpeue5xkblydx6/PID5317513.pdf?dl=0)
* KELM

If you find some bug or have any comment feel free to email me.
