# Extreme Learning Machines

This repository contains my own implementations of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). I implemented that using NumPy and TensorFlow, you can use whatever you want.
I also implemented some variations of this model:
* Online sequential - ELM (OS-ELM)
* Restricted Boltzmann Machine - ELM (RBM-ELM)
* RBM-OS-ELM


## Dependencies
* Python 2.7.x
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* RBM (check my repository)
* Utils (check my repository)
