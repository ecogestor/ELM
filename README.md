# Extreme Learning Machines

This repository contains my own implementations of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). I implemented that using NumPy and TensorFlow, you can use whatever you want.
I also implemented some variations of this model:
* Online sequential - ELM (OS-ELM)
* Restricted Boltzmann Machine - ELM [(RBM-ELM)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417417308102)
* [RBM-OS-ELM](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8489281)
* KELM


If you find some bug or have any comment feel free to email me.


## Dependencies
* Python 2.7.x
* NumPy
* Tensorflow 1.8 (if you wanna use it)
* Scikit-learn
* RBM (check my [RBM](https://github.com/paaatcha/RBM) repository)
